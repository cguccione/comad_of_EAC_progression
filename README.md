The goal of this repository is to show how all figures were produced for ISMEJ Guccione et al. paper. 

## Code Setup  
**Add here the associated yaml file to use the code**   
`conda activate comad_EAC_figures`

If not already in your jupyter notebook, can also add `python -m ipykernel install --user --name=comad_EAC_figures`

**All of the Gillespie Simulation Code used throughout this project comes from [Sieber et al., PLoS Biol. (2019)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31216282/) and [Zapién-Campos et al., J R Soc Interface (2022)](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rsif.2021.0717) this is specified throughout the python scripts and functions in the files. We thank them for their work.**
